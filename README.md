# This is a README File

This one doesn't have much to say, but when you add one to your repository, it'll show up on the webpage in big, bold letters.

It's formatted using Markdown, a pretty simple text formatting language that you're probably familiar with if you use Discord. There's *italics*, **bold**, and ***bold italics***, plus `code blocks` and ~~strikethrough~~,  all kinds of things.

## You can set headers and subheaders pretty easily for organization, too.

* You can even do
* Lists and things
	* That even support indenting!
	* Pretty neat.

> There's your classic blockquotes.

That's most of it, but there's some handy cheat-sheets, guides, and editors out there you can use if you ever get confused.

## Learning markdown is important, because having a nice, pretty, readable README is the first step to having someone be able to clone and compile your code for their own use.
